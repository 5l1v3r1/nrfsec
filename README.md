# nrfsec 

nrfsec is security research tool used for unlocking and reading memory on nrf51 series SoCs from Nordic Semiconductor. 

  - Read all target memory, bypassing the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) settings with integrated read gadget searching
  - Automated unlock feature: read all program and UICR memory, erase all memory, patch UICR image, reflash target into unlocked state
  - boot delay command flag for interacting with target prior to performing memory read, allow for RAM dumps
  - All firmware images are saved for importing into your favorite disassembler 

### Installation

nrfsec is built on the [pyswd library](https://github.com/cortexm/pyswd/) and currently only works with the [ST-Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2548) debugging interface.

nrfsec requires python 3.7+ to run and can be installed with pip

```sh
pip3 install nrfsec
```
### Demo
Extract useful target information.

Read all memory regions on locked targets, including the UICR, FICR, ROM, RAM, and Peripherals.

Read specified memory regions with an optional delay before beginning memory extraction. Great for interacting with the target though any associated mobile applications in order to populate RAM and intialize peripherals.

Lock a target.

Automated unlocking of a previously locked targets. The process extracts the ROM and UICR memory regions, performs a full memory erase, patches the UICR to unlock the target, then finally reflashes the new image. Debug sessions are now possible.

### Usage
```sh
âœ— nrfsec -h
usage: nrfsec <command> [<args>]

perform security related tasks on nRF51 targets through SWD interface

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                        frequency to run the SWD interface (default 4 MHz)
  -v, --verbose         increase output verobsity

supported subcommands:
  {info,erase,restore,read,unlock,lock}
    info                display chip information
    erase               perform a complete erase
    restore             restore specific images to an unlocked chip
    read                read memory contents to outfile
    unlock              unlock the device if locked
    lock                lock the device if unlocked
```
